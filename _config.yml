  Instagram Clone; Creating an Instagram alike prototype that takes in pictures and videos from a particular userâ€™s profile and share them with friends. I started this project as a way of learning Android Studio and it has since then grown into a functionable prototype. It really helped me deep dive into Android Studio for a great experience. 

  Web Portfolio; A Restaurant website that enables online food ordering both while at home and also possible while at the restaurant to dine-in. This helped me to learn more on HTML, CSS. Bootstrap, JavaScript. A personal project is highly recommended in order to learn such languages on a personal level.
